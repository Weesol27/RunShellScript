# RunShellScript
A Jar file that looks for sh files and runs them.  Used for Modded Minecraft servers that are started by sh files.  

During the first run, the Jar file will create a RunShellconfig.txt file, saving the option to use on future restarts. 
To select a different option delete the config file.
